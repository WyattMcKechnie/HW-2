Meteors can be input into the MeteorTracker with either MeteorTracker's .addMeteor() or with Meteor's constructor when the meteor is created.

It is assumed that meteors will be destroyed after output, so they are removed from the queue.

Meteors are listed with the Latitude and Longitude of where they will make impact, thus making them easier to find and individually identify.
